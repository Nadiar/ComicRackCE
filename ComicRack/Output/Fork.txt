ComicRack Community Edition (Modernization Fork):

* NEW: Migrated entire codebase from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET 9.
* NEW: Replaced deprecated IronPython engine with Python.NET (CPython 3.12).
* NEW: Added automated embedded Python distribution downloader to build system (PreparePython.ps1).
* NEW: Implemented 'clr_bridge.py' to handle type marshalling between .NET and Python.
* NEW: Added Python Runtime Trace Reporting system. Traces are logged to 'trace_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log' in the bin directory.
* NEW: Modernized Script Console to run asynchronously, preventing UI freezes during script execution.
* NEW: Added 'Export Trace' feature to Script Console.

* CHANGE: Updated 'Autonumber.py' to compatible with Python 3 types (Explicit Decimal casting).
* CHANGE: Updated High DPI support for modern Windows scaling.
* CHANGE: Build process now uses 'dotnet build' and cleans up stale artifacts strictly.

* BUGFIX: Fixed infinite recursion crash when tracing Python scripts (filtered internal traceback.py).
* BUGFIX: Fixed 'InvalidCastException' in Autonumber.py due to ambiguous overload of System.Convert.ToDecimal.
* BUGFIX: Fixed TypeError in Autonumber.py when adding Integer to Decimal.
* BUGFIX: Solved file locking issues during build by ensuring generic host processes are terminated.
* BUGFIX: Fixed display format of Autonumber wizard to remove unnecessary decimal places.
